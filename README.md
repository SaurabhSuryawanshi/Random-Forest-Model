 Features:-
 
- Random Forest Regressor: Used for continuous target predictions (e.g., house prices, temperatures).
- Random Forest Classifier: Used for categorical target predictions (e.g., classifying spam emails or diagnosing diseases).
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and prepares data for modeling.
- Model Training: Scripts for training both regressor and classifier.
- Evaluation: Includes metrics for assessing model performance.
- Model Persistence: Saves and loads trained models for reuse.

The random forest model include libraries such as:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
